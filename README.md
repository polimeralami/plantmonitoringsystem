Final Year Project (FYP) in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia

A Greenhouse Monitoring System.

The processing of the sensor readings that determine the parameters of temperature, soil moisture, and humidity in the greenhouse implemented by utilizing Arduino IDE, which later work the IoT module automatically in order to maintain two output control which are misting nozzle, and drip irrigation pump. The variables that may be monitored through an Android smartphone include: temperature, humidity of the room, and soil moisture.
